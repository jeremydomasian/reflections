Reflect: Initializing a Repository

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, you're telling Git to get ready to start tracking commits.
You're creating the hidden .git directory, which is where all of the file history and changes will be saved.

Reflect: Staging Area

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's different in that it is the platform or "stage" that is used between the working directory and the repository.
It is the go-to, transitionary platform that allows you to pick and choose what files you want to commit.
It's valuable in that you're able to pick and choose what files you'd like to include in your commit,
thus granting even more flexibility and power to the user.
