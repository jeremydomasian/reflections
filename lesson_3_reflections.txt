Reflect: Using a remote repository

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Probably all the time; more specifically speaking:
- for collaborating on code with others
- sharing code with an audience
- backing up code in case something happens to your local copies

Reflect: Manual vs. automatic pull

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you might be working on something that isn't yet ready for public viewing yet
or the remote repository must stay working/reliable and so should not take in automatic
updates, otherwise it could pull in non-working code.
